# Fitness App!

I created this fitness app following Ed Roh's tutorial \([video link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2NNxr3WPDo&pp=ygUSZWQgcm9oIGZpdG5lc3MgYXBw), [GitHub repo](https://github.com/ed-roh/gym-typescript)\). I really recommend checking his video out for beginners who want to learn how to create a React App from start to finish. My goal was to become more familiar with the steps it takes to create a React App, and build upon my programming skills.

Through this project I was able to practice using the following skills.

**Programming Languages**
